This project was fun to complete and within my skill range because I feel like I am still not too good at coding. So adding in little powerups and the messages was something that I felt comfortable doing and I really like how it came out. I would have liked to get some more score messages because scores in the middle of the game are kind of lacking in messages but I just found it hard to find relevant references for numbers in the 30 to 70 range.
